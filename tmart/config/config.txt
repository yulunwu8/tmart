T-Mart configuration for adjacency-effect correction

# Mar 28, 2024: L9 shares the same configuration as L8

# Thresholds for identifying water pixels, all at TOA level

# Reshape_factor
# In AEC, cell_size is tm_sensor_res * reshape_factor
# It has to be divisible by image resolution of all bands for now 
# Larger value: faster processing, lower accuracy and creating pixel artifacts on the output image
# S2 options: 2, 6, 12, 18, 24; L8 options: any

# Number of cells in AEC along each axis 
# larger value: slower processing, less violation of assuming all diffuse radiation comes from the window
# must be an odd number

# Cloud contribution

# Correcting for AE over land, may cause unwanted changes on nearshore water pixels due to grouped processing. Useful when a large amount of water pixels are falsely masked as land.

# Maximum amount of glint to remove when wind speed is 1 m/s, used when estimating AOT in T-Mart
